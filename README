HOW TO RUN:
        Log on to login.ccs.neu.edu using your public key and forward the agent.
        To run part 'N' simply execute

        $ ./part$N/script.sh

        The scripts start 10 tmux windows in every case and log on to different vm's.
        If any of the VM's are causing issues, the script and hostfile can be changed to accomodate.
